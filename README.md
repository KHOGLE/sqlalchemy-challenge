##Climate Starter
I required assistance from LA Jay with the precipitation plot with the ticker marks smearing together. Otherwise I was able to use class assignments to work out the rest of the code.

##App.py
I required assistnace from LA Sean for the precipitation dictionary because I was over complicating it with a for loop. As I was working out the start vs start/end routes, I tested one of my routes and somehow it redirected me to a prior students' Surfs_Up file. https://github.com/Baylex/surfs_up/blob/main/app.py I already had worked out the sel, queries, and list code but I had them in seperate functions. I thought their clean method of an if loop was superior and thus followed that, though I disagreed with the repetition of the exact same query structure for seperate routes. Otherwise, I used class assignments to work out the rest of the code.
